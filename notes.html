<h1>//File containing notes for Qt/Android summer project</h1>

<h2>// Main features</h2>
    // Status: Thinking about it, maybe leave as-is for now. Because works.
        - To use same script and treat jsonAbData always as temporarily storage data?
          Or to change so that GetContactByID saves result to different var?

    // Status: Looking into States in QML
        - State machine type of solution to tell app what are we doing currently,
        switching things on and off as needed.
        Point is that we can re-use the two UI for multiple things.
        ContactView for Add, Update and Search.
        AddressView for Browsing Contacts and Search results.

<p style="color:green;">    // Status: Working</p>
    // Working: Save, need to add asking for permission on device.
    // Currently manually needed to allow from Settings->Apps->QtAP
        - Local database. Scripts related to that.

    // Status: Planning
        - Changes to UI to make them more suitable for different states.


<h2>// Things to add/change/improve?</h2>
    // Status: Not started.
     - Add text to show last time local data was updated from Cloud

    // Status: Need to look into how to make, currently not important to implement.
     - Progress bar when getting or sending data to Cloud?
      Wouldn't look like it was stuck.

    // Status: Not even thinking about it
        - Transition animations, might look nice and should be easy to implement.

    // Status: Not started
        - Call to number by clicking it, also send email by clicking it

    // Status: Not started
        - Limit what can be inserted into fields.

    // Status: Looking into
        - Learn how to run and make tests

    // Status: Looking into
        - Split addressbook.qml file into smaller files?

            //http-POST

            //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact

            //with fields:

            //firstname
            //lastname
            //mobile
            //email

<p style="color:green;">        //Status: Working</p>
        //Update Contact.

            //http-PUT

            //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact/x

            //WHERE x=id-value

            //and fields

            //firstname
            //lastname
            //mobile
            //email

        //In the application implement all those operations. So that you can get, add and update contacts.
        //If you have still time left, you can figure out yourself what more you could implement. Here are a couple of examples:

<p style="color:green;">    // Status: JS Script with both exact or non-exact results on specific fields. Realtime filtering not started.</p>
        //-Search a contact
        //Example there is a person named Matti Mainio, if you start to type “Mat” or “Mai” ->you will see all the contacts which has those substrings.
        //I didn’t implement that in the API, so you will have to get all contacts and filter in the app.

<p style="color:green;">    // Status: Working. Although needs to manually give permission in Android for using storage</p>
        //-Save to local database
        //Study if it is possible to use SQLite in QtAndroid and if possible save the data to SQLite database.
        //Then the user can use the contact-list also without Internet-connection.
        //You can the add features like “sync to Remote-database” and/or “sync to Local-database”.
