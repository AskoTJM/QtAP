<b>        //Contactlist-API</b>

        //Get all contacts
<text style="color:green;">        //Status: Working</text>
                //http-GET
                //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact

        //Get Contact BY ID

                //http-GET
                //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact/x
                //WHERE x=id-value

        //Add Contact
<text style="color:green;">        //Status: Working</text>
                //http-POST
                //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact
                //with fields:
                    //firstname
                    //lastname
                    //mobile
                    //email


        //Update Contact.
<text style="color:green;">        //Status: Working</text>
                //http-PUT
                //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact/x
                //WHERE x=id-value
                //and fields
                    //firstname
                    //lastname
                    //mobile
                    //email

        //In the application implement all those operations. So that you can get, add and update contacts.
        //If you have still time left, you can figure out yourself what more you could implement. Here are a couple of examples:

        //-Search a contact
<text style="color:green;">        // Status: JS Script with both exact or non-exact results on specific fields. Realtime filtering not started.</text>
            //Example there is a person named Matti Mainio, if you start to type “Mat” or “Mai” ->you will see all the contacts which has those substrings.
            //I didn’t implement that in the API, so you will have to get all contacts and filter in the app.

        //-Save to local database
<text style="color:green;">        // Status: Working. Although needs to manually give permission in Android to use local storage</text>
            //Study if it is possible to use SQLite in QtAndroid and if possible save the data to SQLite database.
            //Then the user can use the contact-list also without Internet-connection.
            //You can the add features like “sync to Remote-database” and/or “sync to Local-database”.

<h2>// Main features</h2>

    // Status: Decided. Sticking with jsonABData.
        <del>Thinking about it, maybe leave as-is for now. Because works.</del>
        <del>-To use same script and treat jsonAbData always as temporarily storage data?</del>
        <del>Or to change so that GetContactByID saves result to different var?</del>

    // Status: Looking into States in QML
        - State machine type of solution to tell app what are we doing currently,
        switching things on and off as needed.
        Point is that we can re-use the two UI for multiple things.
        ContactView for Add, Update and Search.
        AddressView for Browsing Contacts and Search results.

<text style="color:green;">    // Status: Working
    // Working: Save, need to add asking for permission on device.
    // Currently manually needed to allow from Settings->Apps->QtAP</text>
        - Local database. Scripts related to that.

<text style="color:darkblue;">    // Status: Planning</text>
        - Changes to UI to make them more suitable for different states.


<h2>// Things to add/change/improve?</h2>
    // Status: Not started.
     - Add text to show last time local data was updated from Cloud

    // Status: Need to look into how to make, currently not important to implement.
     - Progress bar when getting or sending data to Cloud?
      Wouldn't look like it was stuck.

    // Status: Not even thinking about it
        - Transition animations, might look nice and should be easy to implement.

    // Status: Not started
        - Call to number by clicking it, also send email by clicking it

    // Status: Not started
        - Limit what can be inserted into fields.

    // Status: Looking into
        - Learn how to make and run tests in QtCreator

    // Status: Looking into
        - Split addressbook.qml file into smaller files?
