<b>        //Contactlist-API</b>

        //Get all contacts
<text style="color:green;">        //Status: Working</text>
                //http-GET
                //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact

        //Get Contact BY ID
<text style="color:green;">        //Status: Working</text>
                //http-GET
                //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact/x
                //WHERE x=id-value

        //Add Contact
<text style="color:green;">        //Status: Working</text>
                //http-POST
                //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact
                //with fields:
                    //firstname
                    //lastname
                    //mobile
                    //email


        //Update Contact.
<text style="color:green;">        //Status: Working</text>
                //http-PUT
                //https://qtphone.herokuapp.com/contact/x
                //WHERE x=id-value
                //and fields
                    //firstname
                    //lastname
                    //mobile
                    //email

        //In the application implement all those operations. So that you can get, add and update contacts.
        //If you have still time left, you can figure out yourself what more you could implement. Here are a couple of examples:

        //-Search a contact
<text style="color:green;">        // Status: JS Script with both exact or non-exact results on specific fields. Realtime filtering not started.</text>
            //Example there is a person named Matti Mainio, if you start to type “Mat” or “Mai” ->you will see all the contacts which has those substrings.
            //I didn’t implement that in the API, so you will have to get all contacts and filter in the app.

        //-Save to local database
<text style="color:green;">        // Status: Working. Although needs to manually give permission in Android to use local storage</text>
            //Study if it is possible to use SQLite in QtAndroid and if possible save the data to SQLite database.
            //Then the user can use the contact-list also without Internet-connection.
            //You can the add features like “sync to Remote-database” and/or “sync to Local-database”.

<h2>// Main features</h2>

    // Status: Decided. Sticking with jsonABData.
        <del>Thinking about it, maybe leave as-is for now. Because works.</del>
        <del>-To use same script and treat jsonAbData always as temporarily storage data?</del>
        <del>Or to change so that GetContactByID saves result to different var?</del>

<text style="color:green;">    // Status: Working.</text>
        - State machine type of solution to tell app what are we doing currently,
        switching things on and off as needed.
        Point is that we can re-use the two UI for multiple things.
        ContactView for Add, Update, Search and View contacts.
        AddressView for Browsing Contacts <del>and Search results.</del>

<text style="color:green;">    // Status: Working
    // Working: Save, need to add asking for permission on device.
    // Currently manually needed to allow from Settings->Apps->QtAP</text>
        - Local database. Scripts related to that.

<text style="color:darkblue;">    // Status: Planning</text>
        - Changes to UI to make them more suitable for different states.


<h2>// Things to add/change/improve?</h2>
    // Status: Not started.
     - Add text to show last time local data was updated from Cloud

    // Status: Need to look into how to make, currently not important to implement.
     - Progress bar when getting or sending data to Cloud?
      Wouldn't look like it was stuck.

    // Status: Not even thinking about it
        - Transition animations, might look nice and should be easy to implement.

    // Status: Not started
        - Call to number by clicking it, also send email by clicking it

    // Status: Not started
        - Limit what can be inserted into fields.

    // Status: Looking into
        - Learn how to make and run tests in QtCreator

<text style="color:blue;">    // Status: Some success. Continue later if time, as we can workaround it for now.</text>
        - Trying to split JavaScripts of State machine parts into separate file.
        So we can switch UI components on command, but when run from Component.onComplete causes errors.

<text style="color:green;">    // Status: Mostly working. Some parts I would have wanted to "split" didn't work after it.</text>
        - Split addressbook.qml file into smaller files?
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35118900/how-do-i-split-my-qml-code-into-multiple-files

    // Status: Not started
        - Open notes.html page on app
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14047576/how-to-display-embedded-html-in-qt-webview

<h2>// Bugs and Issues</h2>

<text style="color:purple;">    // Status: Tried to fix unsuccessfully</text>
        - In ABMainView.qml, on left upper corner shows small grey button that runs
        ABBrowseButtonView.qml:abAddressViewGetLocalDB()
        Don't know when it got there, why it got there or how to get rid off it.

<text style="color:blue;">    // Status: Tried to fix, only found a workaround.</text>
        - After returning from ABAddressView.qml to ABMainView.qml,
        next time trying to get into ABAddressView.qml causes an error.
        Issue doesn't happen with ABContactView.qml.
        Workaround: Always when returning to ABMainView.qml abStack.clear() is run.

<text style="color:purple;">    // Status: Tried to fix unsuccessfully</text>
        - When editing TextField on Android emulator, have to press enter before you can
        succesfully edit text. Weird, not sure if bug unrelated to project and we can do anything about it.
        If time left, might look into it and if there is a way to circumvent.
        Didn't see this issue when using real phone.
