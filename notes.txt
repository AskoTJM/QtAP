// File containing notes for project

// GetAllContacts/GetContactByID
    - To use same script (1:1) level and treat jsonAbData as always storage for temporarily store data?
      Or to change so that GetContactByID saves result to different var?


// Things to add/change/improve?
    - Progress bar when getting or sending data to Cloud?
      Wouldn't look like it was stuck.

    //In the application implement all those operations. So that you can get, add and update contacts.
    //If you have still time left, you can figure out yourself what more you could implement. Here are a couple of examples:

    // Status: JS Script working, with both exact or non-exact results.
        //-Search a contact
        //Example there is a person named Matti Mainio, if you start to type “Mat” or “Mai” ->you will see all the contacts which has those substrings.
        //I didn’t implement that in the API, so you will have to get all contacts and filter in the app.

    // Status: In planning.
        //-Save to local database
        //Study if it is possible to use SQLite in QtAndroid and if possible save the data to SQLite database.
        //Then the user can use the contact-list also without Internet-connection.
        //You can the add features like “sync to Remote-database” and/or “sync to Local-database”.
